# PrivateGram API
- This is the api that will handle user and post endpoints.

## Build Instructions
- Set main class to be com.garrettestrin.PrivateGram.app.Main
- Set env variable of PROPERTIES_FILENAME equal to local.properties (you will need to add this file. Ask me for it).
    -- The rest of the env variables will be defined here.
- If you want to run a local mySQL db, you will need to set it up. Schema is coming soon.
- I would suggest setting tests to run before building, so that the build doesn't even start if tests do not pass.
